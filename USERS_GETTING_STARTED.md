# User Getting Started Guide

## Introduction
Welcome to the María José Prader-Willi Syndrome Foundation Dashboard! This guide helps new users get started with our
platform.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have:
- A computer or mobile device.
- Internet connection
- Login credentials (contact Josefina or Claudia in case you don't know them or have forgotten them).

## Access
To access the Dashboard:
1. Go to the [login page](http://majofrontend.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/login).
2. Fill in your email and password.

## Basic Operations
As a Staff member of the Foundation, you can perform the following tasks:

### Consult beneficiary data. 
Each page shows a different view of beneficiary information. The available pages are the General page, Personal
Information, Scholarship, Diagnostics & Ailments and Complimentary Information. To access each page, select the
corresponding one from the drop-down menu in the top right corner of the screen.

Each page presents two views, a Table view and a Graph view. Each Table view contains the data of all beneficiary
entries, different in each page. When in Table view, you can filter, sort and search by name upon beneficiary data by the
different available options.  To filter data, click on the "Filter" button. A side menu with available filtering options
will emerge. Select your filters and press "Apply filters". To sort the table entries, click on the up and down arrows 
besides each compatible column. To search by name and/or last name, type your query on the search bar in the top left 
part of the screen, and press Enter.

### Consult statistical data.
To change between th Table and Graph views, select the corresponding one from the top right part of the screen. The
Graph view shows different statistical information about beneficiaries, like averages, aggregations and most frequent
values. Furthermore, every page presents informative cards at the top, containing additional related statistics.

### Generate reports.
You can generate and download CSV reports of the data in the tables. To do so, first select which table entries you'd
like to appear in the report by checking the checkboxes besides each row. Alternatively, you can also check the
"Select all" checkbox in the top left corner of the table; not checking any box also selects all entries. Once the
wanted entries are selected, click on "Download report" in the top right part of the screen. The CSV file should
download to your device automatically.

### Send emails to tutors.
Tutors are the caregivers of beneficiaries. All staff members can send simple emails to tutors, consisting of a subject
and a body. To do so, traverse to the Tutors page. Just like when creating reports, you can check one or multiple
entries in the table to send the mail to by checking the boxes on the left. Only this time you are not able to send an
email without selecting to whom. After selecting, click on "Send email" at the top right part of the screen. A popup 
with a few fields will emerge. You'll notice the "Recipients" field is autofilled with th email addresses you've
previously selected. Fill in the "Subject" and "Body" with your desired message; you will note be able to send an email
with this fields empty. After you're done, you'll be asked for confirmation. If you're sure of your message, press
"Send". It will automatically be sent from the Foundation's email address. 

Additionally, if you have Administrator privileges, you can also perform the following tasks:

### Edit beneficiary data.
As an Admin, you can update the info of registered beneficiaries in case it changes or there was a mistake during the
registration process. You can also permanently delete beneficiaries from the system, along with all related data, like
their tutor. To update and delete beneficiaries, in any Table view, select the pencil or trashcan buttons on the left
side of their entries.

### Consult, create and edit staff data.
As an Admin, you have access to the Administration Panel page, where you can create, consult, update and delete staff.
The Admin Panel looks like any other page, with a table containing the staff entries,and each entry with a pencil and a
trashcan button. Additionally, there is an "Add user" button on the top right part of the screen, where you can register
new staff and admins. The table on the Admin Panel cannot be filtered on, but you can search by name and last name, and
sort by a few columns.

### Send emails to staff.
Finally, Admins can send emails to the staff and other admins. Just like with tutors, you first select which staff you
want to send the email to by checking the checkboxes on the left. You can then click on "Send email" at the top right
side of the screen. The rest works the same as with tutors, and the emails will be sent from the Foundation's email
address as well.
